# Flow Fields project
Code forked from [MelonFruit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXO_jV3Nlnc)!
Basic visualisation of a flow field using Perlin noise algorithm, as well as some complementary RGB. 
Source code inside `./src/` folder. Use `CTRL+SHIFT+B` > "build debug" && `./build/Debug/raylib_testing` to build and run the project in VSCodium. Throw in a `make clean` and retry in case that doesn't work.
- [ ] TODO: Change the name of the project to actually be related to flow fields, not "raylib_testing"
- [ ] TODO: Implement the other 2 simulation videos: inverse kinematics and boids

# VSCode Users (all platforms)
*Note* You must have a compiler toolchain installed in addition to vscode.

1. Download the quickstart
2. Rename the folder to your game name
3. Open the folder in VSCode
4. Run the build task ( CTRL+SHIFT+B or F5 )
5. You are good to go

# Linux Users
* Rename the folder to your game name
* CD into the build folder
* run `./premake5 gmake`
* CD back to the root
* run `make`
* you are good to go

# MacOS Users
* Rename the folder to your game name
* CD into the build folder
* run `./premake5.osx gmake`
* CD back to the root
* run `make`
* you are good to go

# Output files
The built code will be in the `bin/Debug/` dir

# Working directories and the resources folder
The example uses a utility function from `path_utils.h` that will find the resources dir and set it as the current working directory. This is very useful when starting out. If you wish to manage your own working directory you can simply remove the call to the function and the header.

# Changing to C++
Simply rename `src/main.c` to `src/main.cpp` and re-run the steps above and do a clean build.

# Using your own code
Simply remove `src/main.c` and replace it with your code, and re-run the steps above and do a clean build.

# Building for other OpenGL targets
If you need to build for a different OpenGL version than the default (OpenGL 3.3) you can specify an OpenGL version in your premake command line. Just modify the bat file or add the following to your command line

## For OpenGL 1.1
`--graphics=opengl11`

## For OpenGL 2.1
`--graphics=opengl21`

## For OpenGL 4.3
`--graphics=opengl43`

## For OpenGLES 2.0
`--graphics=opengles2`

## For OpenGLES 3.0
`--graphics=opengles3`

# Adding External Libraries 

Quickstart is intentionally minimal — it only includes what is required to compile and run a basic raylib project.  
If you want to use extra libraries, you can add them to the `build/premake5.lua` file yourself using the links function.

You can find the documentation for the links function here https://premake.github.io/docs/links/

### Example: adding the required libraries for tinyfiledialogs on Windows
tinyfiledialogs requires extra Windows system libraries.
The premake file uses filters to define options that are platform specific
https://premake.github.io/docs/Filters/

Using the windows filter adds these libraries only to the windows build.
```
filter "system:windows"
    links {
        "Comdlg32",
        "User32",
        "Ole32",
        "Shell32"
    }
```

### Cross-platform reminder
If you add a library, make sure to add its required dependencies for all platforms you plan to support (Windows, Linux, MacOS).
Different libraries will have different dependencies on different platforms.
